// Instructions
// Have this array of array’s of neighbouring countries:
//   const listOfNeighbours = [ ["Canada", "Mexico"],
// ["Spain"],
// ["Norway", "Sweden", "Russia"],
// ];
// With the use of two for loops, console log all the countries one by one and in your terminal. You should see something like this in your terminal:
// Neighbour: Canada
// Neighbour: Mexico Neighbour: Spain Neighbour: Norway Neighbour: Sweden Neighbour: Russia



const listOfNeighbours = [ ["Canada", "Mexico"],
["Spain"],
["Norway", "Sweden", "Russia"],
];

for(let i = 0 ; i < listOfNeighbours.length ; i++){

    for(let j = 0 ; j < listOfNeighbours.length ; j++){
        if(listOfNeighbours[i][j] !== -1) {
            console.log(listOfNeighbours[i][j]);
        }
    }
